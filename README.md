# MahjongReader

Shows observed tiles so you don't have to manually count in long games.

BUGS:

- [ ] As tiles shift from recently drawn to hand; the count flickes
- [ ] Honor tiles in the player meld zone sometimes count again next game (visibility issue)
- [ ] concealed Kan do not count as observed tiles

TODO:
- [ ] Highlight discarded tiles when hovering over ones in your hand (Mahjong Soul UX)
- [ ] Show available/disqualified yaku
- [ ] Actually make a struct for all the Emj addon junk (ðŸ™‚)
- [ ] Save game logs after confirming ability to order plays
- [ ] han/fu calculations?
